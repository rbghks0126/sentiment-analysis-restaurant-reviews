COMP30027 - Machine Learning - Project 2 - Code Submission
Gyu Hwan Park | Student ID: 998174


'kaggle_test_predictions' is the final prediction submitted on Kaggle.



'Ass2_code.ipynb' is the python jupyter notebook file.

Can really just run the whole notebook from top to bottom to get everything.
But, some cells take really long to run (5min, 10min+, etc.).
In these cases, I have used pickle and other loading methods to load specific dataframes/files.
'k_best_features_chi2', 'X_train_new.npz', 'X_valid_new.npz' are these files.
You also need to have all the provided data files ('review_text_test.csv', 'review_meta_test',... etc.) in the same folder to run all cells in notebook.



Thanks!
